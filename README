This is a very basic website using the CMS framework. 

make sure the .htaccess is in /   as it redirects /xxx/index.php/param to /xxx/param

install db from:

/_assets/db/framework.sql

Edit these config files to your system:

/application/config/config.php

           $config['base_url']  = "http://your_dev_domain/";
           $config['base_dir']     = "/var/www/html/your_dev_dir/";

/application/config/database.php

           $db['default']['hostname'] = "localhost";
           $db['default']['username'] = "root";
           $db['default']['password'] = "";
           $db['default']['database'] = "framework";

or, if 'development' mode is set in /index.php, edit these as well:

/application/config/development/config.php
/application/config/development/database.php


to access CMS, you will need to login with an admin account. 

http://your_dev_domain/cms

u: admin 
p: framework
