make sure the .htaccess is in /   as it redirects /xxx/index.php/param to /xxx/param

install db from:

/_assets/db/framework.sql

Edit these config files to your system:

/application/config/config.php
/application/config/database.php

or, if 'development' mode is set in /index.php, edit these as well:

/application/config/development/config.php
/application/config/development/database.php
